What is Informatica PowerCenter?

Answer:
Informatica PowerCenter is an ETL tool used to extract data from various sources, transform it based on business rules, and load it into target systems like data warehouses or databases.

2. What is a Mapping in Informatica?

Answer:
A mapping is a set of source and target definitions linked through transformations. It defines how data flows from source to target.

3. What is a Workflow?

Answer:
A workflow defines the sequence of tasks (sessions, commands, emails) needed to execute mappings. It is created in the Workflow Manager.

4. What are Transformations? Give examples.

Answer:
Transformations modify or process data. Examples: Expression, Filter, Router, Aggregator, Lookup, Joiner, Sorter.

5. Difference between Connected and Unconnected Lookup?

Answer:

Connected Lookup: Receives input row-by-row through pipeline.

Unconnected Lookup: Called only when needed using a lookup function; better for selective lookups.

✅ Intermediate Level (Moderate)
6. What is the difference between Filter and Router transformation?

Answer:

Filter: Only one outgoing path; rows not matching condition are dropped.

Router: Multiple output groups; can route data into different groups based on conditions.

7. How do you improve performance in Informatica mappings?

Answer:

Use sorted input for Aggregator

Use Filter early in the pipeline

Avoid unnecessary lookups

Use joiner with master-source sorted

Remove unused ports

Use partitioning

Optimize SQL override in source qualifier

8. What is Pushdown Optimization?

Answer:
Pushdown Optimization pushes transformation logic into the source or target database, reducing processing in Informatica and improving performance.

9. How do you handle NULL values in Informatica?

Answer:

Use NVL, IIF, ISNULL functions in Expression transformation

Configure Lookup to treat Null keys appropriately

Use default values when necessary

10. What is a Reusable Transformation?

Answer:
A transformation created and saved in the repository so it can be used in multiple mappings. Examples: Reusable Lookup, Reusable Expression.

✅ Advanced Level (Hard)
11. Difference between Normalizer and Denormalizer in Informatica.

Answer:

Normalizer: Converts columns to rows (used for COBOL/legacy data).

Denormalizer: Converts rows to columns (implicitly done with Aggregator, Expression, or Pivot logic).

12. How does Dynamic Lookup Cache work?

Answer:
Dynamic Lookup Cache allows the lookup cache to be updated during the session. If new rows appear, Informatica inserts them into the cache. This is used for CDC or upsert scenarios.

13. How to load the last N records from a flat file in Informatica?

Answer:
Approaches:

Use Sorter to sort on descending key and use Filter to pick top N.

Use Sequence Generator + Router logic.

Preprocess file using command task (Unix tail).

14. Explain how you implement SCD Type 2 in Informatica.

Answer:
Steps:

Compare incoming data with target using Lookup.

If row is new → insert as new record.

If row changed →

Update existing row’s end date, flag = inactive.

Insert new row with start date, flag = active.

Use expression to identify changed columns.

15. Informatica practical scenario: Remove duplicates without using Aggregator

Answer:
Possible Methods:

Use Sorter with “Distinct” option checked.

Use Expression + Router with row comparison logic.

Use SQL override in Source Qualifier and SELECT DISTINCT directly.
