Q1. Explain Teradata’s MPP architecture. (Theoretical)
A: Teradata uses Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) where data is evenly distributed across multiple AMPs (Access Module Processors). Each AMP works independently on its portion of data, allowing Teradata to scale horizontally and process huge workloads efficiently.


Q2. What is a Primary Index? What happens if you choose a bad PI? (Theoretical)
A:

Primary Index determines how rows are distributed across AMPs.
If chosen poorly → data skew, AMP imbalance, slow queries, spool overflow.

If one AMP has significantly more rows → Skew issue.

.3

Explain what “full table scan” means in Teradata and how to avoid it.
Answer:
A Full Table Scan occurs when Teradata must read all rows on all AMPs.
To avoid it:

Ensure appropriate stats are collected
Use selective WHERE clause
Choose proper PI for even distribution
Use secondary indexes if helpful
Avoid functions on indexed columns

Q4. What is COLLECT STATISTICS? When do you use it? (Theoretical)
A:
COLLECT STATISTICS gathers metadata about data distribution, cardinality, and uniqueness.
Used to help the optimizer choose efficient execution plans.

5. what is the difference between Primary Key vs Primary Index in Teradata?
Answer:

Primary Key = relational uniqueness constraint
Primary Index = Teradata physical data distribution mechanism
Rows with the same PI value go to the same AMP; PK does not determine distribution.

6.How does Teradata handle deadlocks?
Answer:
Teradata uses a Deadlock Detection Algorithm. If deadlock occurs:

System aborts the youngest transaction
Rolls back automatically
Issues error 2631: Transaction aborted
You can view conflicts in DBC.LockInfoV.

7. When should you use MULTISET tables?
Answer:
Use MULTISET tables when:

Duplicates are expected and allowed
Removing duplicates is expensive
Staging / snapshot data loading scenarios

⭐ SECTION 2 — SQL (5 Questions + Answers)

Q1. Difference between WHERE, HAVING, and QUALIFY. (Theoretical)
A:

WHERE: Filters rows before aggregation.
HAVING: Filters after aggregation (GROUP BY).
QUALIFY: Filters after window functions (Teradata-specific).

Q2. Write a query to fetch the latest record per customer. (Practical)
A:

 
SELECT *
FROM customer_history
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER()
OVER (PARTITION BY cust_id ORDER BY update_ts DESC) = 1;


Q3. What are window functions? Give examples. (Theoretical)
A: Functions that perform calculations across a set of rows without collapsing them.
Examples: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LAG(), SUM() OVER().


Q4. Write SQL to find the top 3 highest salaries in each department. (Practical)
A:

 
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT emp_id,
dept_id,
salary,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
FROM emp
) t
WHERE rnk <= 3;


Q5. Explain difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL JOIN. (Theoretical)
A:

INNER: Only matched rows.
LEFT: All from left + matches from right.
FULL: All rows from both sides (matched + unmatched).

⭐ SECTION 3 — DATA WAREHOUSE (DWH) (5 Questions + Answers)

Q1. Explain Fact Table and Dimension Table. (Theoretical)
A:

Fact Table: Contains numeric measures (sales_amount, clicks).
Dimension Table: Descriptive attributes (customer, date, product).
Facts = “what happened”, Dimensions = “context”.

Q2. What is SCD Type 1, Type 2, Type 3? (Theoretical)
A:

Type 1: Overwrite old data (no history).
Type 2: Add new rows with versioning (full history).
Type 3: Add “previous value” columns (limited history).



Q4. Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema. (Theoretical)
A:

Star: Dimensions are denormalized → fewer joins → faster.
Snowflake: Dimensions normalized → more joins → saves space.

Q5. Write SQL to aggregate monthly sales by region and category. (Practical)
A:

 
SELECT region,
category,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4;

Git


What is Git, and how is it different from other version control systems? (Theoretical)
A:
Git is a distributed version control system, meaning every developer has a full local copy of the repository.
Unlike centralized systems (SVN), Git enables:

Offline commits
Faster branching/merging
Better collaboration
Local history backups

Q2. What’s the difference between git merge and git rebase? (Theoretical)
A:

Merge: Combines branches and creates a merge commit → preserves history.
Rebase: Rewrites commits on top of another branch → cleaner linear history.
Rebase is preferred for feature branches, merge for collaborative branches.

Q3. How do you resolve merge conflicts? (Practical)
A:

Run:

 
git merge <branch-name>

Git flags conflicting files.
Edit files manually and resolve markers <<<<, ====, >>>>.
Add resolved files:

 
git add <file>

Commit:

 
git commit


Q4. What does git stash do? Provide a scenario. (Theoretical + Practical)
A:
git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes and restores the working directory to a clean state.

Scenario:
You are working on a feature but need to switch branches urgently to fix a bug:

 
git stash
git checkout hotfix-branch


Q5. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed? (Practical)
A:
Use git revert (safe for shared branches):

 
git revert <commit-id>

This creates a reverse commit, preserving history, avoiding rewrite issues.

cicd

What is CI/CD and why is it important? (Theoretical)
A:
CI/CD automates integration, testing, and deployment of code.

CI = auto-build + auto-test on every commit
CD = auto-deploy to environments
Benefits: faster releases, fewer errors, consistent quality.

Q2. Name common tools used in CI/CD pipelines. (Theoretical)
A:

Jenkins
GitLab CI
GitHub Actions
Azure DevOps
Bamboo
CircleCI
ArgoCD (for GitOps)

Q3. Write an example CI pipeline step that runs tests after a commit. (Practical)
(Example: GitLab CI)

 
test_job:
stage: test
script:
- echo "Running unit tests..."
- pytest tests/ --maxfail=1

This automatically runs tests on every commit merge request.


Q4. What is the difference between Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment? (Theoretical)
A:

Continuous Delivery: Build → test → ready for deployment; manual approval required.
Continuous Deployment: Fully automated; code is deployed to PROD without manual steps.

Q5. How do you handle secrets in CI/CD? (Practical)
A:
Avoid storing secrets in code. Use tools like:

Azure Key Vault
AWS Secrets Manager
HashiCorp Vault
Jenkins Credentials
GitLab Protected Variables
Best practices:

Encrypt secrets
Rotate regularly
Never store in environment files in repo
